### Pyssrs rules file.

### This file holds the rules for analyzing the source file.
### The rules are necessary for the script to be functional
### I.e. there will be no renaming or editing if there are no
### rules how this should be done.

### Each rule starts with a line that (only) has a [RULE] tag and
### ends with a line that (only) has a [/RULE] tag.

### Please note that the order of the rules is important. The rules
### listed first are considered first.

### For simple strings no single quotes are needed.
### If the string has spaces either in the beginning or in the end,
### USE SINGLE QUOTES TO INCLUDE THE PRECEDING OF TRAILING SPACES.
### As such, SINGLE QUOTES ARE NOT USABLE CHARACTERS to search and replace.

### Also, three hashes (###) is used to denote a comment line in this file.
### So you should not try to search for ### in the files.


### Below are the rule fields explained followed by an example.
### -----------------------------------------------------------

### RULE_DESCRIPTION =
### Non-formal title for user reminder and to enhance readability of
### the rule list and the log.

### STRING_SEARCH =
### The string to be searched for in file's name or on the line inside the file.

### STRING_REPLACE =
### The string that replaces the original string in the file's name / line inside the file.
### If empty the string will be removed from the filename / line in the file.

### STRING_EXCLUSION_RULE =
### Optional: User can fill here one string that causes the file / line inside the file to be skipped
### if found in the file name or on the same line inside the text file as the STRING_SEARCH .


### --------------------------------------------------------
### Example rule below (not active because of the hashtags):

### [RULE]
### RULE_DESCRIPTION = Remove _OLD -tags from filenames and replace with _ARCHIVED
### STRING_SEARCH = _OLD
### STRING_REPLACE = _ARCHIVED
### STRING_EXCLUSION_RULE = _NEW
### [/RULE]

### This ends the information section, below are user defined rules.
